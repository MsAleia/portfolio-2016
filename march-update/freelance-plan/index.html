                        <p>
                            Hi, i'm <span>Aleia Walker</span> a Freelance <span>Web Developer</span> and mentor to freelancers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Three years ago I started a job as an unhappy corporate drone. I immediately <span>knew that something needed to change</span>, so I started looking for skills that would let me quit my full-time job and work on my own terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I <span>tested out a few side hustles</span> before settling on web development! It wasn't an easy journey and I did not have limitless funds or time - so I made sure <span>I could learn and apply a lot with a little</span> by only investing in meaningful strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Six months after starting to learn new skills, <span>I started freelancing</span>. And a year later, <span>I quit my full-time job</span>. And I feel like <span>I provide value to someone every damn day</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Three months after quitting my day job, <span>I doubled my income</span>. And I'll triple it by the one year mark.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Iâ€™m not a unicorn or a fairy or some other mythical creature who is the only one who ever experiences these things. You can make this your story.
                        </p>
