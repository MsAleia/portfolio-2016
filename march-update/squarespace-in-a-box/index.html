                <h2>What is Squarespace in a box?</h2>
                <p>It's a Squarespace website with all of the parts that you don't know that you need. You work with your designer to figure out what you need where and how to DIY all the parts because you don't have $5,000 to spend on your first website.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Resources on DIYing your brand</li>
                    <li>A custom content plan and guided resources to create that content</li>
                    <li>2 1-hour consultation calls</li>
                    <li>A fully-loaded Squarespace website that you know how to use</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <h2>Who is this for?</h2>

                        <h2>A little about Aleia</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hi, i'm <span>Aleia Walker</span> a Freelance <span>Web Designer/Developer</span> and Web Development Instructor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Three years ago I was an <span>unhappy corporate drone</span>. I did not feel valued at work and no one missed when I was gone.</p>
                        <p>
                            I knew that something needed to change, so I <span>started looking for skills that would make me more attractive</span> - skills that would let me quit my full-time job and work on my own terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I <span>tested out a few side hustles</span>. Calligraphy, woodworking, business writing, and social media strategy to name a few untilsettling on web development and design - it's now one of my greatest passions!
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            It wasn't an easy journey and I did not have limitless funds or time - so I made sure <span>I could learn and apply a lot in a little time, with little money</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Six months after starting to learn new skills, <span>I started freelancing</span>. And a year later, <span>I quit my full-time job</span>. And I feel like <span>I provide value to someone every damn day</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Are you next?</span>
                        </p>
