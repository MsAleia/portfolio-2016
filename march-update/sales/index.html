                        <p>
                            Hi, i'm <span>Aleia Walker</span> a Freelance <span>Web Designer/Developer</span> and Web Development Instructor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Three years ago I was an <span>unhappy corporate drone</span>. I did not feel valued at work and no one missed when I was gone.</p>
                        <p>
                            I knew that something needed to change, so I <span>started looking for skills that would make me more attractive</span> - skills that would let me quit my full-time job and work on my own terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I <span>tested out a few side hustles</span>. Calligraphy, woodworking, business writing, and social media strategy to name a few untilsettling on web development and design - it's now one of my greatest passions!
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            It wasn't an easy journey and I did not have limitless funds or time - so I made sure <span>I could learn and apply a lot in a little time, with little money</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Six months after starting to learn new skills, <span>I started freelancing</span>. And a year later, <span>I quit my full-time job</span>. And I feel like <span>I provide value to someone every damn day</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
