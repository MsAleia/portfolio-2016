	        	A self-taught frontend developer + designer with a passion for mobile-first responsive design, minimalism, and user experience.

	        <p class="edu-bio">
	        	I attended the University of Miami where I received degrees in Creative Writing and International Studies. I intended to develop a career in academia but I pivoted after following my masters. I spent a few months as a freelance writer before taking a job where I serve customers everyday.

		        <p class="bio-copy">
		        	I revisted my graphic design design skills and translated them to UX and UI skills. I chose a text editor and then got to work finding my niche in web development. My sweet spot starts around UX and ends around the development of a responsive layout + JavaScript functionality. I share my journey online, mostly on <a href="https://twitter.com/msaleia">Twitter</a>, and have found an amazing tech community. I'm missing that in real life and can't wait to find a team as I continue to realize my dev dreams.
